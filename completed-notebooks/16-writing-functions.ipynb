    "### Simulating a dynamical system\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. A canonical example of a dynamical system is the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a growth model that computes a new population density (between  0 and 1) based on the current density. In the model, time takes discrete values 0, 1, 2, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function called `logistic_map` that takes two inputs: `x`, representing the current population (at time _t_), and a parameter `r=1`. This function should return a value representing the state of the system (population) at time _t_+1, using the mapping function \n",
    "\n",
    "   x(t+1) = r * x(t) * [1 - x(t)]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using a `for` or `while` loop, iterate the `logistic_map` function defined in part 1, starting from an initial population of 0.5, for a period of time `t_final=10`. Store the intermediate results in a list so that after the loop terminates you have accumulated a sequence of values representing the state of the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,_t_final_. Print this list to see the evolution of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulate the logic of your loop into a function called `iterate` that takes the initial population as its first input, the parameter `t_final` as its second input and the parameter `r` as its third input. The function should return the list of values representing the state of the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,_t_final_. Run this function for periods `t_final=100` and `1000` and print some of the values. Is the population trending toward a steady state?"
