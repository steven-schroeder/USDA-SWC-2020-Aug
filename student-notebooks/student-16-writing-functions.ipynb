A canonical example of a dynamical system is the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a growth model that computes a new population density (between  0 and 1) based on the current density. In the model, time takes discrete values 0, 1, 2, ...\n",

Store the intermediate results in a list so that after the loop terminates you have accumulated a sequence of values representing the state of the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,_t_final_. Print this list to see the evolution of the population.\n",

Encapsulate the logic of your loop into a function called `iterate` that takes the initial population as its first input, the parameter `t_final` as its second input and the parameter `r` as its third input. The function should return the list of values representing the state of the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,_t_final_. Run this function for periods `t_final=100` and `1000` and print some of the values. Is the population trending toward a steady state?"
